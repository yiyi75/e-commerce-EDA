## E-commerce Conversion Funnel Analysis: Customer Journey Optimization
This [[notebook link]](https://github.com/yiyi75/e-commerce-EDA/blob/main/ecommerce_customer_journey.ipynb) presents a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior patterns in the Udemy e-commerce dataset, with a focus on understanding and optimizing the conversion funnel. 
The analysis employs multiple visualization techniques to identify bottlenecks, track performance trends, and provide actionable insights for improving user experience and conversion rates.

### Key Analytical Components:

**1. Customer Journey Funnel Analysis**
- **Stage-by-stage conversion tracking**: Quantify user progression from landing page to order completion
- **Drop-off rate identification**: Pinpoint critical stages where users abandon the conversion process
- **Conversion rate optimization**: Analyze transitions between each funnel stage to identify optimization opportunities

**2. Cohort-Based Behavioral Analysis**
- **Monthly cohort segmentation**: Group users by acquisition month to track retention and conversion patterns
- **Trend identification**: Analyze how conversion behaviors evolve across different user cohorts over time
- **Comparative performance**: Evaluate which cohorts demonstrate the strongest conversion characteristics

**3. Multi-dimensional Performance Dashboard**
- **Multi-funnel visualization**: Horizontal bar charts showing progression rates with drop-off indicators
- **Stream plot cohort analysis**: Visual representation of conversion distribution across multiple cohorts
- **Key performance indicators**: Consolidated metrics including overall conversion, cart abandonment, and stage-specific performance
- **Actionable insights**: Data-driven recommendations for improving specific conversion bottlenecks

### Analytical Objectives:
1. **Identify Conversion Bottlenecks**: Determine which stages of the purchase process experience the highest drop-off rates
2. **Track Performance Trends**: Analyze how conversion metrics evolve across different user cohorts
3. **Provide Optimization Recommendations**: Offer specific, data-backed suggestions for improving conversion rates
4. **Establish Performance Benchmarks**: Create baseline metrics for ongoing performance monitoring

### Methodology:
- **Data Processing**: Clean and structure session-level data to track user progression through the conversion funnel
- **Cohort Construction**: Segment users by acquisition period to enable time-based behavioral analysis
- **Visual Analytics**: Employ multiple chart types to present the same data from different analytical perspectives
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate conversion rates, drop-off percentages, and cohort performance metrics

### Expected Outcomes:
- Clear identification of the most critical conversion barriers in the current user journey
- Understanding of how user conversion behaviors have changed over time
- Specific recommendations for optimizing the conversion funnel
- A reusable analytical framework for ongoing e-commerce performance monitoring
